              Hi! I'm Viona, a passionate self-taught UI/UX designer with a
              background in the Food and Beverage (F&B) industry. Transitioning
              into design was driven by my love for creating meaningful,
              user-friendly experiences.

              Although I don't hold a formal degree, my hands-on experience as a
              freelance designer speaks volumes. I've worked on diverse
              projects, designing websites and mobile applications using Figma.
              My approach focuses on blending creativity and functionality to
              solve real-world problems while ensuring visually appealing
              designs.

              My journey from F&B to UI/UX design has equipped me with a strong
              understanding of user behavior, teamwork, and adaptability. I'm
              constantly learning and staying updated with the latest trends to
              craft impactful designs that users love.
